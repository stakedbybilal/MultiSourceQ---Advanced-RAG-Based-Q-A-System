# 🔍 AI-Powered Q&A System with LangChain, RAG, and Groq

An intelligent, lightning-fast Q&A application built using **LangChain**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Groq**. This project leverages vector search over scientific and general knowledge sources like **Wikipedia** and **arXiv** to deliver accurate, contextual answers in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **LangChain-Powered Pipeline** – Manages the RAG workflow efficiently
- ⚡ **Groq LLM Inference** – Ultra-fast response generation using Groq hardware
- 📚 **Multi-source Retrieval** – Contextual search over Wikipedia, arXiv, and custom documents
- 💡 **Semantic Search** – Embedding-based similarity for relevant document fetching
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Q&A** – Provides grounded, explainable responses using real data
- 🌐 **Modular Design** – Easy to extend with new data sources or LLMs
